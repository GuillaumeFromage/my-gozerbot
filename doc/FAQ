__copyright__ = 'this file is in the public domain'

1) when i install the bot and try to make it join a channel it says userhost denied. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

   your client's userhost and the owneruserhost entry in the config file
   don't match. use the userhost in the denied message as your owneruserhost

2) i want to change a permission of a command.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   sometimes you want to give a different permission to a command. instead of
   changing the code, you can add the new permission to a file called 
   'permoverload' .. see files/permoverload for an example. 
   permission is assigned to the function name of function handling the 
   command. you can use the code-funcnames command to see what function names
   live in a  plugin. the permoverload file needs to be placed in the
   gozerdata dir.

   NEW:

   instead of using the permoverload file one can use the "chanperm" command
   to set the permission of a channel .. see the "whatperms" command what
   permission are available .. note that not all permission can be used as some
   commands can not be used anonymously. examples of permissions to use are
   ANONKARMA and ANONQUOTE

   EVEN NEWER:

   commands can now be allowed for anon users with the all-add command.
   example: all-add version

3) the bot doesn't connect to the server.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   set loglevel to 0 so you can see what messages the server is sending back.

4) i want to let the bot give auto-op.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   add the channel name to the status of a user .. setstatus <username>
   <channel> .. use getname <nick> to get a username of a user.
