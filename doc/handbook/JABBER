Jabber

__copyright__ = 'this file is in the public domain'

- the jabber part of the bot works like the irc version .. the userhost
  gets replaced by the JID. to add new users to the bot use the user-add
  command .. !user-add <name> <jid> .. if you use !meet <nick> in a conference
  an user with jid channel@server/nick wil be created.
  the bot will only recognize you as owneruserhost in a direct message to the 
  bot .. NOT in a conference.

  NEW:

  if you give the bot owner or admin affiliation it will use the proper JID of
  a user, not the channel JID

- to join a conference use !join <conference> .. 
  example: !join gozerbot@conference.jabber.xs4all.nl/nick

- relaying between irc and jabber fleet bots is possible

- if you use a irc bot in the fleet the owner will not be recognized so you
  need to add your irc userhost to the owner ..
  example: !user-adduserhost owner bart@r8.cg.nu
